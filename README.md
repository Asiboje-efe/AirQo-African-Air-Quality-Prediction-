## Background 
### Overview
AirQo African Air Quality Prediction aims to predict air quality around Africa using Sentinel 5P satellite data. The project focuses on estimating pm2_5 levels from satellite observations based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) for four cities in four African countries. Air pollution is a major environmental health risk globally, it contributes to 7 million premature deaths globally each year with developing countries being the most affected [World Health Organization (2021)](https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/345329). <br/>
### Project Question
Can Sentinel 5P data be used to predict air quality around Africa for environmental justice?<br/>
### Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the air quality prediction models will be evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.<br/>

## Findings


## Conclusion 
Light Gradient Boost Model was able to predict air quality around Africa using Sentinel 5P satellite data. It had the lowest RMSE and MAE, highest R-squared value compared to Random Forest Regressor. This indicates that the LGBM model  made predictions closer to the actual values as it captured the underlying patterns in the data more effectively.
